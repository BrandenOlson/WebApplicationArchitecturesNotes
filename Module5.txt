Lecture 1 : What is Middleware?
===============================

The "meat" of a web app
Middleware is the "software glue" between the OS and applications on 
	each side of a client-server architecture
	* Provides service to apps not available from the underlying OS
	* Allows multiple processes running on different machines to 
		interact
	* We won't dig too deeply, but we'll focus on how MVC is implemented 
		on top of it
	
In Rails, middleware stack, called Rack, is automatically provided.
	Rack provides unified, simple interface that allows apps to talk to 
		web servers
		* Mongrel, Thin, Phusion, Apache
		* Handles HTTP requests and responses
		* Used to group and organise modules, written in Ruby, specify 
			dependencies between them
		
Other Ruby frameworks, e.g. Sinatra, are also built on top of Rack
rails server
	* a Rack::Server object is created and attached to the web server, 
		middleware components are loaded
	* Rack::Server#start method starts the web server, listens for HTTP 
		requests

Lecture 2 : HTTP Introduction
=============================

HTTP is the foundation for data comm on the Web
Involves request/response interactions

HTTP is an application layer protocol used to deliver resources in 
	distributed hypermedia info systems
	* Initiates activities inplemented over the middleware
	* Response typically returns resources to the browser
	* Vital to understand for building and debugging web apps
	
HTTP - Resources
Resources delivered typically include HTML, CSS, hypermedia, and scripts
	Hypertext - text displayed on a computer (or other device) 
		containing references to other hypertext
		* User can immediately access, usually via mouse click
	Hypermedia - Logical extension of hypertext to graphics/audio/video
	Hyperlinks - Define a structure over the Web
		* Google exploits this structure when determining relevance
	Scripts - Code that can be executed on the client side 
		* Typically JavaScript
		* Led to a lot of security exploits
		
HTTP - Background
	HTTP protocol is extremely lightweight and simple - hence its 
		success
	With HTTP/0.9 (first protocol) you could only issue GET request, 
		i.e., asking server for a resource
		* The server could only return HTML
	Ex: GET /welcome.html
		* Hopefully the server returns contents of requested file, your 
			browser would render it
	HTTP/1.0 extended it to include request headers along with 
		additional request methods (DELETE, POST, etc.)
	HTTP/1.1 - Faster response, allowed multiple transactions over 
		single, persistent connection
		* Faster response and bandwidth savings via cache support
		* Faster for dynamically-generated content
		* Efficient use of IP addresses
		* Support for proxies
		
HTTP - Basics
	Always been a stateless protocol : Does not require server to retain 
		info between client requests
	Each client request is executed independently, w/o knowledge of prev 
		requests
	Hard for web apps to respond intelligently to user input
		- i.e., to create interactivity
	Cookies, sessions, URL encoded parameters and a few other 
		technologies have been introduced to address this issue
		* Allowed for emergence of Web 2.0 and 3.0 apps
		
HTTP Sessions
	HTTP client (browser) establishes TCP connection to a port on a host 
		server (typically port 80), and initiates request
		* May first involve using a DNS server in order to obtain an IP 
			address
			- Translates URL to particular IP address
		* HTTP server listening on port waits for request message
		* Processes request, sends back status line ("HTTP/1.1 200 OK"), 
			along with a response
			- response could be requested resource, error message, or 
				other info
		
Lecture 3 : HTTP Requests
=========================
Client side consists of 3 parts: Request line, header, message body

Request line identifies the resource along with desired action that 
	should be applied to it
	The resource is typically identified by a Universal resource 
		Identifier (URI)
	Note : A Uniform Resource Locator is a specific type of URL
		HEAD : response the resource would supply to GET request, but 
			without response body
		GET : return representation of resource
		POST : submit data to resource, where data is supplied in body 
			of request
			Either creates or updates a resource
		PUT : submit representation of resource
		DELETE
		TRACE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, PATCH
	
	HEAD, GET, OPTIONS, TRACE are safe methods : No side effects on 
		server
		* Information retrieval
		* Should not change state
		* If GET is safely implemented, can make arbitrary GET requests 
			without worry
			- Can cache request and save a lot of computation
		
	POST, PUT, DELETE may cause side effects on server - considered not 
		safe
		However, PUT and DELETE methods should be idempotent
			- Multiple identical requests should have the same effect as 
				a single request
			- Safe methods are also idempotent
		
Headers : Primary part of HTTP request
	Contains parameters of request
	Header fields start with field name, colon, then field value
		Ex: 
			Accept: text/plain
		eX: languages acceptable to client
			Accept-Language: en-US
	Field names and values may be any app-specific strings
	Core set of fields is standardized by Internet Engineering Task 
		Force (IETF)
	HTTP message header must be separated from message body by blank 
		line
	
Message body is optional
	Typically includes user-entered data/ files being uploaded to server
	D3efines various characteristics of data
	May contain number of fields
	Usually header liens in message that describe body
	
	Ex: Content-Type: specifies the MIME-type of the data in message 
		body
	Ex: Content-Length : specifies # bytes
